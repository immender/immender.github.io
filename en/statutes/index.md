## Annual Statutes of Canada ##
The <cite>Acts of the Parliament of Canada</cite>, short title <cite>Statutes of Canada</cite> (abbreviated S.C.) are a periodical publication compiling the acts of the Parliament of Canada as they were enacted in each calendar year. Prior to 1985, each session volume was published at the end of its respective session of parliament.

Before being compiled, statutes are published at shorter intervals in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>.

Each chapter of an annual or sessional volume corresponds to an enactment and represents the act as it was originally passed.
