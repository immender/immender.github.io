		A logic puzzle is a game which can be played alone or with the help of others. The goal is to complete the puzzle while following the rules of the game. A logic puzzle can be completed either with a pencil and paper or digitally. Each type of puzzle follows a set of rules which is unique to it. The solution to a puzzle can usually be found through deduction.
